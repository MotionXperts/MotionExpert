You will be given an instruction provided by the coach.

Your task is to rate the instruction on one metric.


Evaluation Criteria:

Time Detection (0-1) - The instruction contains wording that clearly includes time-related information.for example like: when take off, during the landing... 
0: The instruction doesn't mention time-related information.
1: The instruction clearly mentions time-related information.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the coach's instruction carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Check if the instruction contains any wording that clearly includes time-related information. Ensure that the athlete can understand when and how to act after hearing the instruction. Just like these three coaching instructions: "Remember to keep your posture straight and vertical during the initial stages of the jump, it will help in achieving the correct form.", "Bend your hands a bit at takeoff to aid your spin." and "Stretch your right side backward and left side forward beforehand to increase power."
3. Assign a score for Time Detection based on the Evaluation Criteria.
