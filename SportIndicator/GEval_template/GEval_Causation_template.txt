You will be given an instruction provided by the coach.

Your task is to rate the instruction on one metric.


Evaluation Criteria:

Causation Detection (0-1) - The instruction contains any wording that can describe the logic of the motion or its cause-and-effect relationship clearly.
0: The instruction doesn't clearly point out the cause-and-effect relationship of the motion.
1: The instruction clearly points out the cause-and-effect relationship of the motion.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the coach's instruction carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Check if the instruction contains any wording that can describe the logic of the motion or its cause-and-effect relationship clearly. Ensure that the athlete understands exactly what the logic of the motion is after hearing the instruction. Just like these two coaching instructions: "Practice keeping your left leg closer to your right foot and lifting your left knee higher to help create more power for a higher jump because you are not fully rotating your jumps right now." and "Remember to keep your posture straight and vertical during the initial stages of the jump, it will help in achieving the correct form."
3. Assign a score for Error Detection based on the Evaluation Criteria.

Example:
Coach's Instruction:
