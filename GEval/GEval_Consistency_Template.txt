You will be given an instruction provided by the coach. You will then be given one rephrased version of that instruction. 

Your task is to rate the rephrased version on one metric.

Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent rephrased version contains only statements that logically follow from the original instruction. 


Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the coach's instruction carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Read the rephrased version and compare it to the coach's original instruction. Check if the rephrased version contains any factual inaccuracies that are not supported by the original instruction.
3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.

Example:
Coach's Instruction: 

{{Document}}

Rephrased Version: 

{{Summary}}
