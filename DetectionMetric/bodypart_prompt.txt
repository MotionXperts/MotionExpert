You will be given an instruction provided by the coach.

Your task is to rate the instruction on one metric.

Evaluation Criteria:

Body Parts Detection (0-1) - The instruction contains any wording that includes body parts clearly.
0: The instruction doesn't clearly point out the body parts.
1: The instruction clearly points out the body parts.


Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the coach's instruction carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Check if the instruction contains any wording that can point out the body parts clearly. 
   Ensure that the athlete understands exactly which body parts to focus on after hearing the instruction.
   Just like these two coaching instructions: 
   "Practice moving your left foot along the ice towards your right foot, without lifting it too soon." and 
   "Keep your right leg from going over your left leg during takeoff for a smoother jump. Ensure your right toe lock stays firm. Manage your hands, don’t lift them too high while spinning, and make a circle with them."
3. Assign a score for Error Detection based on the Evaluation Criteria.

Example:
Coach’s Instruction: 

{{Instruction}}

Evaluation Form (scores ONLY):
Body Parts Detection: [Insert score here]

You only need to give a score of this example directly.ONLY OUTPUT A SINGLE NUMBER (0 or 1) WITH NO ADDITIONAL TEXT.
